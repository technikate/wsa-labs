  Solution to Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data
---

The following is a solution to the lab titled ["Lab: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass"](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/lab-login-bypass).

In Burp Suite, in the Proxy tab, click **Intercept is off**. This turns Intercept on, which will capture any incoming HTTP requests.

In the user interface (UI) of the lab, attempt to log in using the username `administrator` and any password (in this case, `orange`). 

Burp Suite Proxy will capture the login attempt and show an editable HTTP request like the one below:

~~~
POST /login HTTP/2
Host: 0ad800d703f1319f80653f68009c00e5.web-security-academy.net

In the last line of the HTTP request, modify the text after `username`, adding `'--`. Note the following modified request.

~~~

Click **Forward** and then click **Intercept is on** (to turn off Intercept).

Navigate back to the UI. The UI should be logged in to the `administrator` account, and the lab should be marked as solved.

SQL Note

The unmodified request sends a SQL query with the username `administrator` and the password `orange` to the back end for authentication. This login attempt fails, since `orange` is not the correct password.

Adding `'--` after the username in the login request modifies the SQL query by instructing the server to regard everything after `'--` as a comment, thus telling the server to only check the username to give the user access to the account.
